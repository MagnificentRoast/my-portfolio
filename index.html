            Hi, everyone, my name is Drew Harris. I have been working with computers for as long as I can remember, and this portfolio is an example of the projects I have been working on as of late. I've been in web development for only a short time, but I would love to work with you to prove myself. I hope my work can speak for itself. To contact me, send an email to <a href="mailto:magnificentroast@gmail.com">magnificentroast@gmail.com</a> and I will answer ASAP.
        </p>

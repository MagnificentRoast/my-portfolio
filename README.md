# my-portfolio
I welcome you to the readme file for my portfolio, here you will find detailed information about my portfolio. To begin with, my portfolio link is as follows: https://magnificentroast.github.io/my-portfolio.

If you have any questions, send me an email at magnificentroast@gmail.com, I will get back to you as soon as I am able.

So far I have added the id selectors "about-me" and "my-projects", added class selectors of "about-me" and "my-projects" as well, began with semantic HTML, linked the CSS stylesheet to the main HTML document, and added a universal selector to the stylesheet with only font-family in there, I haven't changed anything else otherwise, so far a decent skeleton.
